    "    - Abstratc Classes cannot be instantiated i.e. Objects cannot be created\n",
    "    - An abstract class can contain both abstract or normal(non-abstract) methods\n",
    "- Abstract Method\n",
    "    - A method which is declared as abstract method using decorator @abstractmethod is know as Abstract method\n",
