## Abstraction

Hiding the implementation or behaviour is know as abstraction.

- Abstract Class
    - A class which inherits ABC and have atleast one abstract method is known as Abstract Class
    - Abstratc Classes cannot be instantiated i.e. Objects cannot be created
    - An abstract class can contain both abstract or normal(non-abstract) methods
- Abstract Method
    - A method which is declared as abstract method using decorator @abstractmethod is know as Abstract method
    - Where the method is defined immediatiely after the decorator
python doesn't support abstration we implement abstraction using or importing ABSTRACT BASE CLASS

## Encapsulation

- Wrapping data and methods
- Restriction on access

## Protected members

- Cannot be accessed outside the class
- Can be accessed within the class and its subclass
