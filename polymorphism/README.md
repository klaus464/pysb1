# Polymorphism

1. Duck Typing
2. Operator Overloading
3. Method Overloading
4. Method Overriding

## Duck Typing

If it looks like duck, walks like duck, quacks like duck then it must be a duck

when an object is a able to acquire properties of another object it is known as Duct Typing.

## Method Overloading

Python does not support method overloading as thier can only be one function with a specific identifier, but method overloading can be obatined by changing the control flow of that function.

## Operator Overloading

In python operators also lead to function calls and these special functions can be overloaded by implying them in different classes.

Note: which function
